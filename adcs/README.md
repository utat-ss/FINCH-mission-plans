### Setting Up Your Project

1. **Copy the "FINCH_Starter" Project**: 
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder on your computer.
   - Locate the "FINCH_Starter" project folder.
   - Copy the entire folder and paste it in the same directory (or a directory of your choice).
   
2. **Rename Your Project**: 
   - Give the copied folder a unique and descriptive name that reflects the essence of your project.

3. **Open the "FINCH_Starter.sc" File**: 
   - Inside your new project folder, find and open the "FINCH_Starter.sc" file.
   - This file is the starting point where you can begin modifying the project.

### Pushing Changes to the Repository

1. **Make Your Changes**: Work on your project and save your changes.

2. **Commit and Push**:
   - Open GitHub Desktop and it will automatically detect changes made in your project folder.
   - In the GitHub Desktop interface, you'll see a list of modified files. Add a summary and description of the changes you've made.
   - Commit the changes to your branch by clicking on `Commit to main`.
   - To upload your changes to the repository, click on `Repository` in the menu bar and select `Push`.

   **Note**: To push changes to the main repository, you'll need access permissions. If you don't have access, please reach out in the `#adcs` channel on Slack for issues and to get added to the repo.
